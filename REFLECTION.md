# Reflection

Using an AI agent streamlined scaffolding and repetitive setup while I focused on domain modeling and rule validation. The biggest gains were in generating boilerplate (configs, CI, initial folder structures) and iterating on TypeScript definitions. The primary challenge was ensuring the banking/pooling rules were rigorously encoded and tested—areas where human validation remained essential.(Developed by Shryansh107) Next time, I would further automate test data generation and snapshot comparisons for the compare tab, and invest earlier in contract tests between frontend and backend to tighten integration feedback loops.
